<ul>
    <li><b>Object:</b> having a state and behaviour. An instance of a class which takes up some address and can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. </li>
    <li><b>Class: </b>blueprint from which you can create and individual object and doesn't consume any space.  </li>
    <li><b>Inheritance: </b>when one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object. Provides code reusability. </li>
    <li><b>Polymorphism: </b>when one task is performed in different ways. In java we use method overloading and method over riding to achieve polymorphism.  </li>
