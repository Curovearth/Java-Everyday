<h2>CONSTRUCTOR</h2>

<ul>
    <li>If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor</li>
    <li>Default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null etc. depending on the type</li>
    <li>A constructor which has s specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.</li>
    <li>Constructor overloading is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task.</li>
