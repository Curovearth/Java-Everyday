<h1>FACTORIAL PROGRAM IN JAVA</h1>
<p>Factorial of n is the product of all the preceding numbers of n till 1 with n giving an example i.e., if n=5 then factorial of 5 represented as 5! is 5x4x3x2x1 = 120.</p>
<p>Factorial is normally used in permutations and combinations involving binomial principles.</p>
<p>Herein we'll be discussing two ways of calculating factorials -</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using Loop</li>
    <li>Using Recursion</li>
</ul>
