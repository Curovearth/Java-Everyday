<h2>Difference between == Operator and equals() Method</h2>
<p>In java, the == operator compares that two references are identical or not. Whereas the equals() method compares two objects.</p>
<p>Objects are <b>equal</b> when they have the same state (usually comparing variables). Objects are <b>identical</b> when they share the class identity</p>
