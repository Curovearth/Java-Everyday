<h1>FIBONACCI SERIES</h1>
<p>A series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.</p>
<p>The simplest is the series 1,1,2,3,5,8...</p>
<br>
<h2>Fibonacci Sequence Formula</h2>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence of numbers "Fn" is defined using the recursive relation with the seed values F0=0 and F1=1</p>
<p><b>Fn=Fn-1 + Fn-2</p>
<p>Here it is defined using two different parts, such as kick off and recursive relation</p>
<h2>Fibonacci Sequence List</h2>
<p>The list of the first 20 terms in the Fibonacci Sequence is</p>
> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181
